# Defin - A New Generation of Peer to Peer Finance
## Inspiration

A lot of our inspiration comes from making crypto a more widely accessible technology. Since blockchain is a new, niche technology, adoption has been very slow. Blockchain is suffering from the same issues personal computing did back 1970s. For the everyday individual, the idea of blockchain is daunting, not inviting, and lacks usability. DePay aims to fix that by making crypto simple, putting the customer first, and integrating the tech with the customer's needs in mind.

# What it does

DePay is an all-in-one crypto wallet that prioritizes usability and simplicity. When sending money from one user to another user, users can simply input the desired username, rather than having to recite what could be many complicated wallet addresses.

# How we built it

For our demo, we utilized a plurality of technologies: -ReactJS -NextJS -Vercel -Solana -WebJS -NextUI -CockroachDB -SQL

# Challenges we ran into

To begin, we made the HORRIBLE mistake of building this project with the intention of the demo working on Solana. This project could be miles further in complexity and most likely possess tons of features had we initially created the implementation for Ethereum. Due to the ever-changing nature of blockchain technologies, frameworks built today may be rendered completely obsolete in only a few months. This leads to documentation being misleading, and a lot of our time was dedicated to figuring out how to fix deprecated systems.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building a react app that doesn't break (for the most part) is honestly such a nice feeling. Especially understanding essentially every line of code is just so cool to us. Ultimately, all of us at DePay are proud to be able to say that we learned so much. To create so much in such a small amount of time does nothing but put a smile on our faces, even if things don't always work out how we wanted them to.

# What we learned

We learned tons of technology and the importance of perseverance in regard to technology.

# What's next for DePay

I believe DePay can be the largest player in FinTech. DePay can easily be the largest player in crypto finance due to the customer base it would have. Once we put Crypto into the hands of everyday consumers, DePay can own a majority of the market share for peer-to-peer transactions using crypto, and maybe even B2C AND B2B. Think about Stripe + Venmo for Crypto.
